summary: Comparing mobile OS market shares purely by size misses out on the relative financial value of those market shares.

In an early episode of Aaron Sorkin's "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip," the network president explains the value of getting written up in *Vanity Fair*:

> "Alpha consumers are the first to know, the first to try, and the first to buy. They are influencers and pleasure-seekers. The typical *Vanity Fair* reader is college-educated and lives in a household with a six-figure income. You can lose 5 regular consumers, replace them with one alpha consumer, and I can charge the same ad rates, you understand what I'm saying?"

All comparisons of iPhone vs. Android in terms of market share seem to focus entirely on the size of each platform's market segment and disregard the value of those segments entirely.

At the end of 2010, iPhones accounted for [less than 5% of all phones sold][1], but brought in 51% of phone sales profits. What does this mean? Sure, Android may be reaching a larger chunk of the market, but it's a *lower-value* market segment. iPhone owners have money and are willing to spend it. Because Apple consistently charges a premium for its devices, it has created a consistently high perceived quality for its products and garnered a user base that values that quality enough to pay the premium.

Android, on the other hand, may be carving out a larger chunk of the market, but by positioning itself widely, offering hundreds of devices that fall everywhere on the price and design spectrum, it's diluting the perceived prestige of owning an Android device, the perceived quality of Android as a platform (due to inconsistencies across the Android ecosystem), and the value of the consumers who purchase an Android phone, in general.

So while Android's market share is consistently growing and shows no signs of stopping, I believe Apple's market segment is far more valuable in terms of marketing dollars and development effort. If you merely want to reach more eyeballs, Android is the platform to target; however, if you want to reach the users who have money and are willing to spend it, the alpha consumers who flock to Apple are the demographic to aim for.
