summary: Some rules to help make the online world a better place.

1. The Internet is for communication.

    If you’re hindering effective communication, cut it out.

2. Don’t read the comments.

    Corollary: You will learn when it’s a good idea to read the comments.

3. Avoid philosophical arguments.

    Religious, moral, and political arguments are all philosophical.

4. Educate, don’t humiliate, those who admit ignorance.

    Saying “I don’t know” is the first step on the path to knowledge.

5. Challenge your opinions as often as possible.

    Consider new information, but account for information quality.

6. Admit errors graciously.

    Everyone is wrong sometimes. It’s okay.

7. You are never the smartest person in the room.

    Learn from those who know more. Teach those who know less.

8. You’re not the only one.

    Someone else has been here before. Make a connection.

9. Give credit where it’s due.

    You didn’t get here on your own.

10. Don’t hoard knowledge.

    Share what you learn.

11. Cultivate empathy.

    Understanding others’ feelings will improve every interaction.

12. Know what you’re saying.

    Words mean different things to different people.

13. If it’s online, it’s not secret.

    Corollary: If you do it in public, it will end up online.

14. Let it sit for a day before you hit “send”.

    With time comes clarity.

15. You can’t bother a machine.

    Do your research before you interact with people.

16. Assume people are good.

    Strive to remain positive.
