I will never retweet your message for a chance to win, because I value my friends as human beings, not tools I can use to gain something for myself. They value me because I try to say thoughtful and interesting things, and because I'm not just another route for unwanted advertising to enter their lives.

I will never retweet your message for a chance to win, because I don't want to be seen as willing to propagate your brand just because there's something in it for me. If I tell my friends about a company or product, it's because I have personally decided that that company or product is worth promoting. When you offer me a chance to win in exchange for me bothering my friends, it's obvious that you don't care about my relationships except merely as a source of potential income.

I will never retweet your message for a chance to win, because what I say and do online is as much a reflection of who I am as what I say and do offline. I am not indiscriminately opportunistic, and I won't bother my friends in exchange for a few extra gigabytes here or a free MP3 there. The fact that you think I will speaks volumes about how much you respect me as a person.

I will never retweet your message for a chance to win.
