summary: My fledgling zeitgeist.css project aims to provide a zero-effort modern design to any simple page, as well as a historical record of web aesthetics.

One of the most important things I as a web developer can do to ensure a strong, healthy web is to make sure that people who want to learn to make websites can do so with a minimum of difficulty. I'm not talking about using a WYSIWYG editor that churns out HTML and CSS behind the scenes; that's not encouraging learning or experimenting or understanding. I mean helping people who already know a little about HTML and a little about CSS get past the early stumbling blocks and launch their first site and feel proud of it.

In the web community, we all work hard to continue bettering ourselves and furthering our understanding and keep up with the insane pace of technological change. We strive to follow the changes in specs and learn the quirks of the various browsers, and in doing so, slowly establish a shared understanding of best practices, in technology, accessibility, usability, etc. The problem is, doing this and having any grasp at all of _why_ the best practices are what they are is a full-time job, and amateur webmakers don't have the knowledge necessary to reach that level of understanding.

So I think there's value in putting together projects that not only allow these budding website creators to easily implement best practices, but that also allow them to learn the reason and history behind the best practices. That's why I started a new community-driven design project, [zeitgeist.css][1].

The project has two goals: first, by linking the CSS file on an HTML page, the page will be given a clean, modern design that makes use of as many design, usability, accessibility, and readability best practices as possible. In this way, amateur webmakers who can put together a straightforward HTML page but have only a minimal understanding of design and CSS can still create a site with a decent modern design, and because it's linked to a regularly-updated file, the page's design will remain up-to-date.

Second, by keeping zeitgeist.css up-to-date with best practices and the current web aesthetic, the repository will serve as a historical record of these design principles, which can serve to educate web designers who want to learn how web design has evolved over time. Tools could be built to easily switch between versions and see the differences. Commit messages and comments can explain the rationale behind the changes, and discussion of contributions and issues raised can help aid in understanding as well.

zeitgeist.css is meant to be opinionated. By including it, your page shouldn't look basic or boring. It should look modern and stylish, and impart some sort of strong sense of modern design. To do this, it needs community contributions, whether in the form of actual code or just discussion and feedback. If you have any thoughts or opinions or questions about this, please raise them in the [zeitgeist.css repo's issues][2]. If you're a designer and think that the CSS doesn't reflect current modern aesthetic, say so or send a pull request with changes that _do_ make it reflect that. By far the best way to help the project meet its goals is to participate and help get the word out to the wider design community. If you think this project is interesting or worthwhile at all, please help me move it forward and remove roadblocks from the paths of potential webmakers everywhere.
