Details matter. When you put something on the web (or on paper), even seemingly minor spelling and grammar mistakes will affect how visitors and users perceive both you and your creation.

Whether it's the README in the root folder of your open source project's tarball or the content of your company's homepage, it's equally important. When someone's making a decision about what to choose, all else being equal, seeing "it's" where there ought to be "its" can trigger that little twinge of wrongness that tips the scale.

If you're a programmer, attention to detail is key to your art. Programmers have to understand that tiny changes in code&mdash;a decimal point here, an errant space there&mdash;can completely change the logic of what's going on or the entire output of a program. When you're writing to convince someone of something, tiny errors in your spelling or grammar can have the same effect on their perception and understanding. The first impression your code makes on someone unfamiliar with it is the description or documentation you've written, and if they see that you haven't taken care of the details in your writing, they'll naturally assume your lack of attention extends to your code as well.

And it's not just the writing about the code, either: the names you use in the code itself should be spelled properly, and your commit messages should be grammatically correct. Take the time to fix that *getParrameter* function everywhere it's called, and remember: *git commit --amend* and *git rebase -i* are your friends.

If you're writing the copy for a company's website, where your goal is to convince potential customers that you're worth giving their money to, having grammatical errors in your text conveys the same thing: you're not careful about your writing, and you may not be careful about their investment, either.

Recently, a small Vermont-incorporated New York&ndash;based business made headlines, and I went to check out their website. They offer a platform for crowdfunding socially responsible business ideas, and, in essence, are asking you to pay them to help you get your business idea off the ground. I clicked on their "About" link, and was greeted with this:

> By the way, crowdfunding is when a lot of people give money to fund something, non-profits and politicians have been doing it for years.

This blatant comma splice immediately conveyed a sense of amateurishness&mdash;not the sort of thing you're aiming for when you want people to entrust you with the financial well-being of their goals and dreams.

This weekend I heard about an interesting JavaScript library to make more responsive mobile web apps. The one-page brochure site the programmer had put together was simple and straightforward, with a slick demo and a few paragraphs of explanation. I was practically sold on the library just by looking at the demo, but when I read the copy, I came across this:

> All you have to do is pass in the container element, set some parameters, and BOOM goes the dynamite&ndash; your all set.

That simple homophone error (among other things) made me step back and wonder how many little details the programmer might have missed in his code as well.

If you're not a great writer, don't worry. Chances are good you have a friend who is more than willing to proofread and offer suggestions before you show your words to the public. You know that guy everyone calls "grammar nazi"? That woman at work who is always so pedantic? Trust me: they would *love* to look over your text and tell you where you've dangled a modifier or pluralized improperly. Ask sincerely, take some time to understand what they're saying (they'll gladly explain it), look up the rules for avoiding subject-verb disagreements and when to use *which* vs. *that*, and it can only help. Just as it's important to have a coworker do a code review before you merge your branch, another set of eyes can be an invaluable asset when you're writing.

And no matter how much you learn, typos and thinkos happen to everyone, and [Muphry's Law][1] is inevitable. Everyone makes mistakes; smart people proactively minimize them.
