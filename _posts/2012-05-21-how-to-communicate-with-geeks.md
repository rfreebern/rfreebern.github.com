"Hey, got a sec?"
-----------------

Want to annoy a geek? Open a chat with the line above. Depending on their mood and what they're working on, this will cause anything from mild annoyance to seething anger. Most of the time you'll still get a polite response, because despite their geekiness they're still conscientious human beings, but now and then they'll snap and tell you off.

If you're not a geek, this seems like a totally harmless and even friendly way to open a conversation. To a geek who's busy being productive (or _trying_ to be productive), it's a slap in the face. Understanding why first requires understanding a key part of the geek mindset.

Efficiency is King
------------------

[Larry Wall][1] famously wrote that the three cardinal virtues of a programmer are laziness, impatience, and hubris. The first drives coders to write code that reduces the amount of work they need to do, and write documentation that reduces the number of questions they have to answer. The second encourages coders to write code that does as much as possible so that the human using the code doesn't have to. Finally, the third makes a coder try to write code that is praiseworthy, to reduce complaints they have to deal with.

Do you see the common thread there? _Efficiency._ All three of those virtues are about getting more done in less time overall. A geek's wet dream is to write a piece of code that works perfectly, does everything anyone needs within its purpose, is instantly understandable to everyone, and garners nothing but praise from those who use it. If all code was like this, eventually computers would do everything for us without us having to lift a finger, and humans could spend all their time in pursuit of lofty goals in art and philosophy, or something like that.

Unfortunately, geeks spend their entire lives writing code that doesn't ever quite reach that pinnacle of perfection, which is frustrating. All geeks constantly struggle with this frustration, and while they do so, time keeps passing. Inefficiencies in life take some of that valuable time away from the pursuit of perfect code, which, frankly, drives us nuts.

The Efficiency Killer
---------------------

The conversation opener at the beginning of this piece is an efficiency killer. It conveys a single bit of actionable information -- "someone wants my attention" -- and leaves an impending string of questions completely wide open. It could lead to anything. Once you respond, the next statement could be anything from "fresh pot of coffee in the kitchen!" to "our Asia-Pacific data center just went dark unexpectedly". A message like the one above is saying "I want you to drop what you're doing and talk with me, but before I give you any useful information, I want you to expend effort on drawing that information out of me."

Other similar statements, even ones that appear to convey more information, can be just as problematic:

* "Has anything changed with feature X lately?" Why do you ask? Is there unexpected behavior? Is it problematic or dangerous? Are you looking for who did the work or trying to find out what was done? Do you want to know how long it's been since it was under active development?
* "The site's down." What evidence do you have? What do you mean by "down"? What have you tried to diagnose this?
* "Can I ask you a question?" You just did, and it got us nowhere. **Don't ask to ask, just ask.**

Some people think, "why should I bother worrying about my first question when I don't even know if I'll get a response?" First, we live in an age of always-connected, everything's-logged communications. Other than voice calls, practically everything is persistent. Ask your question, provide as much information as possible, and be fairly certain that it'll be sitting there on their phone or their tablet or their desktop next time they glance up from their work.

How to Communicate with Geeks
-----------------------------

Get to the point. Skip the niceties -- this isn't a social call: you're trying to _get shit done_. Given a goal, do everything you can to provide as much information as possible toward reaching that goal. If you think you've found a bug, figure out how you caused it, what platform you're on, what input you used, when you did it, what you clicked on, what you typed, etc. If the site's down, say what browser you're using, whether you tried it on anyone else's computer, whether the browser's showing an error or a blank page or just spinning forever, etc.

A great way to think this through is to apply those virtues of a programmer to your communication. Laziness: try to communicate in a way that reduces the amount of work the recipient needs to do. Impatience: try to anticipate the recipient's needs and answer their questions before they're asked. Hubris: try to communicate as clearly and thoroughly as possible so that you're known as "the best bug-reporter" or "the clearest questioner" or, possibly the highest praise a geek can give a non-geek colleague, "someone who really helps me get stuff done".
